# Tweet-dapp  
The tweet-dapp is a totally decentralized app.We can post our tweets via it and our tweets will store in the blockchain of Etheruem.We can modify personal information via the tweet-dapp,of course the tweet-dapp use IPFS storing personal information.  
The tweet-dapp is an earlier version.There are also many functionalities I need to complete for it. 
The source code of tweet-dapp is in my GitHub. 

✅ Utilized the React to implement the function of the front end. 
✅ Used the programming language Solidity with Ethereum platform to implement smart contracts. 
✅ Integrated IPFS to store the background picture of user  for raising efficiency and reduce cost. 
✅ Setted up a NFT project,all of user can customize profile picture via this NFT project as well as the metadata of NFT can changed by the temperature from a set city.  
✅ Introduced Hardhat as a framework to test and deployment for contracts.I can easily access block chain information from the object of Hardhat in the test's environment and Hardhat can accord to the sequence I defined to deploy 
✅ Utilized Fleek platform to deploy the front end react project.Fleek is a decentralized platform and it can deploy your project on IPFS to make the front end project completely decentralized.
